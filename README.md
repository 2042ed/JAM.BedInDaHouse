# Bed in da House
a game designed and developed by kids and teens at the Global Game Jam 2019

A group of kids (from 10 to 14yo) designed and developed this game as part of the Kids Global Game Jam group in Rome, where the tutors help the next generation in designing and having fun in making games.

We used opensource technologies (the Unity Playground and Fungus framework), with tilemaps and graphics drawn in MagicaVoxel, and the dialogues, music and level design done by the kids themselves.
