# Bed in da House

![game title](docs/images/game_title.jpg)

a game **designed and developed by kids and teens** at the [Global Game Jam 2019](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/bed-da-house), with the theme _"What home means to you"_

the team (from 10 to 14yo) worked in Rome, with the help of their parents/tutors.

They used open-source technologies ([Unity Playground](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityPlayground) and [Fungus framework](https://github.com/snozbot/fungus)), learning **tile maps** and drawing in [MagicaVoxel](http://ephtracy.github.io/), writing and acting the dialogues, playing the music and having lots of fun designing the levels, characters and puzzles.
